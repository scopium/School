Guest Speaker: Bill Stewart ( Best Practices in Sales Management)
    * Sales person for Tang, Gatorade and other US corporations.

        * Recruiting - "4 I"
            - Integrity - does the right thing
            - Intelligence - smart person
            - Initiative - can they take charge
            - Intuition -
            - (Empathy) - sale the way you like to be sold to.
                        - manage people how you want to be managed.
        * Retention
            - Impossible to motivate people. They either have it or not.  People have to be self motivated.
            - The solution is how to not de-motivate them.
        * Sales Leadership
            - Be the support for the sales team, to move the block and obstacles so i can do my job correctly.
            - Have at least one key account so that you are still in the business and not taken away to the coorporate
                meetings.
        * Compensation
            - Based + commission (no cap)
            - Gross Margin
            - Team Incentive
        * Pricing
            - The bad
                - When order does not arrive on time
                - When pricing increases
                - When there is collection issues
            - When pricing goes up
                - Transparency.
                    - tell ur clients about prices and costs.

Situational Examples.
  1. VP Sales Marketing
    - Core Values - develop core values within yourself and the group. - it will lead to success.
  2. Conflict
    - Exaust every option you have before firing the person
  3. Customer concentration.
    - Empathy.


The greatest joy is to get to see people perform at levels that they did not think they could.

Notes: Relationship Selling does not work.  Product Selling works.
